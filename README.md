<h1 align="center">:spider_web: Web Scraper :computer:</h1>

Web scraping is the practice of extracting content and data from a website using bots. Web scraping, unlike *screen scraping*, which replicates only the pixels seen onscreen, retrieves the underlying HTML code and, with it, the data contained in a database. The scraper can then copy the full website's content to another location. This custom code searches the source code of the page for specific parts defined and extracts the content asked to extract.

### :warning: Beware
Before scraping any website, check the **_terms and conditions_** page to determine if there are any clear scraping rules. You should follow them if there are any. If there aren't any, it's more of a _guessing game._

#### :pensive:Note
- Sadly, not all websites support web scraping.

## :high_brightness: Best Practices when Web Scraping
- Never scrape more frequently than you need to.
- Consider caching the content you scrape so that itâ€™s only downloaded once.
- Build pauses into your code using functions like `time.sleep()` to keep from overwhelming servers with too many requests too quickly.
