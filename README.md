<h1 align="center">:spider_web: Web Scraper made with Beautiful Soup:computer:</h1>
Web scraping is the practice of extracting content and data from a website using bots. Web scraping, unlike _screen scraping,_ which replicates only the pixels seen onscreen, retrieves the underlying HTML code and, with it, the data contained in a database. The scraper can then copy the full website's content to another location. This custom code I built searches the source code of the page for specific parts I've defined and extracts the content I've asked it to extract.

### :warning: Beware
Before scraping any website, check the **_terms and conditions_** page to determine if there are any clear scraping rules. You should follow them if there are any. If there aren't any, it's more of a _guessing game._

## :high_brightness: Best Practices when Web Scraping
- Never scrape more frequently than you need to.
- Consider caching the content you scrape so that itâ€™s only downloaded once.
- Build pauses into your code using functions like `time.sleep()` to keep from overwhelming servers with too many requests too quickly.
